#### Common Setup

set REPO_ROOT [exec git rev-parse --show-toplevel]
cd ${REPO_ROOT}

source examples/cross-language-end-to-end-tests/common.exp

#### Test Setup

set timeout 30

# Spawn both processes in the background
spawn cargo run --bin component-tests_rust
set id_rust $spawn_id
spawn target/ff/cc/build/component-tests/cxx/component-tests_cxx
set id_cxx $spawn_id

#### Test Assertion

expect_output_from $id_rust "Waiting for clients to connect..."
expect_output_from $id_cxx "Waiting for clients to connect..."

            return $exit_code
        }
    }
}

# Wait for both processes and get their exit codes
set exit_code_rust [wait_for_exit $id_rust]
